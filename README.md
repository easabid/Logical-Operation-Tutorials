- **Show** – Retrieve data from the database and display it
- **Update** – Modify existing records in the database
- **Edit** – Changes datas that already added in database
- **Delete** – Remove records safely and securely

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C#** (for logic and UI)  
- **MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server)** (for database management)  
- **ADO.NET** (for database connectivity and operations)
