Basic CRUD Application with C# and MSSQL
This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using C# with Windows Forms as the user interface. It allows users to manage records in a database by performing the four basic operations on data: adding new records, retrieving/displaying records, updating existing records, and deleting records.

Here‚Äôs an updated **README.md** file, reflecting the instructions on how to import the `.bacpac` file from the project repository.



## üì• Importing the .bacpac File

The `.bacpac` file for the database has been uploaded to this repository. You can import this file into your local SQL Server instance using the following steps:

### Steps to Import the `.bacpac` File:

1. **Download the .bacpac file**  
   - Navigate to the repository where the `.bacpac` file is located.
   - Download the file to your local machine.

2. **Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**  
   Launch SQL Server Management Studio to work with SQL Server databases.

3. **Import the .bacpac file**  
   - In SSMS, right-click on **Databases** in the **Object Explorer**.
   - Select **Import Data-tier Application**.
   
4. **Follow the Import Wizard**  
   - Click **Next** in the wizard.
   - Select the **Import from local disk** option.
   - Browse to the downloaded `.bacpac` file.
   - Follow the prompts to import the database and assign it a name.

5. **Update the Connection String in Your C# Project**  
   After importing the database, make sure to update the **connection string** in your C# project to reflect the newly restored database:


     SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(@"Data Source=MSI\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=""Crud Operation"";Integrated Security=True;");


6. **Run the Project**  
   Once the connection string is properly set up, run the project to interact with the database and perform the CRUD operations.
